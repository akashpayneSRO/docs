[TakeShape](https://www.takeshape.io/) provides instant, intuitive, adaptable, and collaborative services to power JAMstack projects of any size, shape, or complexity.

In this guide, you will discover how to create a [TakeShape blog](https://crystallize.now-examples.now.sh/), and deploy it with [ZEIT Now](/).

## Step 1: Creating Your TakeShape Project

Create a [TakeShape account](https://app.takeshape.io/signup). From the [TakeShape dashboard](https://app.takeshape.io/projects), create a new **Shape Blog** project.

Once created, you will be taken to the project dashboard. Create an API key with **Read** permission. Make a note of this as it will not be shown again.

With the API key created, you can move on to creating your Next.js blog that will use the data from the TakeShape project.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Next.js Blog

Set up a Next.js project by cloning the [project template](https://github.com/takeshape/takeshape-samples/tree/master/shape-blog-nextjs) and moving into the project directory:

<Snippet dark text="git clone https://github.com/takeshape/takeshape-samples takeshape-samples && cd takeshape-samples/shape-blog-nextjs" />
<Caption>Initializing a Next.js + TakeShape project and moving into the project directory.</Caption>

## Step 3: Adding Your API Key as a Now Secret

Using [Now CLI](/download), create [Now Secrets](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets/) to securely store both the API key received in [Step 1](#step-1:creating-your-api-keys), along with the project `id`.

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add TAKEHSAPE-API-KEY [your-takeshape-api-key]" />
<Caption>

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add TAKESHAPE-PROJECT [your-takeshape-project-id]" />
<Caption>
  Adding the <InlineCode>takeshape-project</InlineCode> as a <strong>Now Secret</strong>.

## Step 4: Deploying Your Blog with ZEIT Now

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

export default ({ children }) => <Guide meta={meta}>{children}</Guide>

export const config = {
  amp: 'hybrid'
