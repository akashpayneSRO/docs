## Missing Public Directory

When a [Project](/docs/v2/platform/projects) is imported for the first time, the [framework](/docs/v2/build-step/#optimized-frameworks) is automatically detected along with the expected Output Directory.

You are seeing this error because your framework did not produce the expected Output Directory.

To resolve this error, edit your Project Settings with the following steps:

1. Visit <https://zeit.co/dashboard>
2. Click "Projects" in the menu bar to view all your projects
3. Click the name of your project you wish to edit
4. Click "Settings" in the menu bar
5. Find the "Build & Development Settings" section
6. Select the expected "Framework Preset" in the dropdown
7. Enable "Override" switch beside the "Output Directory" input
8. Enter the expected expected directory name
9. Click "Save"

Your must deploy again for the Project Settings to take affect. Previous deployments will not be modified.

## Missing Build Script

If your project contains a `package.json` file, no `api` directory, and no `now.json` configuration, it is expected to provide a `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) that performs a static build of your frontend and outputs it to a `public` directory at the root of your project.

When properly configured, your `package.json` file would look similar to this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "[my-framework] build --output public"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>build</InlineCode> script in a{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file that specifies the output
  directory.
</Caption>

Once you have defined the `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), this error will disappear. Furthermore, it will not be displayed if you are using `package.json` purely to provide dependencies for your Serverless Functions located inside the `api` directory.

## Platform Version Detection

[Now CLI](/download) will automatically upgrade your deployment to the latest platform version if you import a project or if your project meets certain criteria. In order for this to work, you must:

- Remove any Dockerfile.
- Remove the `type` property from your `now.json` file.
- Remove the `start` script from your `package.json` file.
- Remove the `server.js` file from the root of your project.

It is possible to opt out of this behavior by creating a `now.json` file with a `version` property.

If you are yet to upgrade to the latest platform version, please read our [upgrade guide](https://zeit.co/guides/migrate-to-zeit-now/).

## Green Energy Policy

ZEIT works with multiple cloud partners in order to provide services to end users.

The Serverless approach is an energy-efficient alternative to traditional servers because your code runs only on-demand.

For more information on our cloud partners' Green energy policies, we recommend viewing their documentation:

- [AWS Sustainability Timeline](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/sustainability-timeline/)
- [Google Cloud Sustainability](https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/)
- [Microsoft Environmental Sustainability](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability)

## What can I deploy with ZEIT Now?

ZEIT Now is best at deploying technologies that can be served over HTTP and distributed through our CDN network:

- Static websites and static generators (React, Vue, Angular, etc)
- Code that renders HTML on the server-side
- API endpoints that query databases or web APIs and return dynamic data

In general, most popular technologies and languages already have [quickstarts](/docs/v2/introduction#quickstarts) or [guides](/guides) you can start taking advantage of today.
